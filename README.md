# Basic-Port-Encryption
This is a basic port scan encrypter
According to your wishes this code takes port value from you. After that it asks you that how much input you want to add your design for encryption. And according to the sequence it locks your port until you send nmap port scans to specific port address. 

Warnings!!!
This program is just a basic bash script program with python. I use iptables to configure firewall configuration.
I didnt do bug fixing.
!! When someone who didnt send the port scan sequence for decryption, system locks(filtered) the port again.
